# Tip-Calculator Project:

**This project is currently in the development stage**

## About the project
This project will end up becoming a iOS app using swift. The functionalities of the app are as follows: 
The app will allow the user to specify the amount in dollars their total bill was (restaurant, haircut, taxi, etc)
Then the app will prompt for what percent the user wants the tip to be. There will be some predetermined options shown,
as well as allowing the user to select themselves what percent they would like to tip.
Then the app will prompt for how many people are sharing the bill, and then calculate exactly what each person needs to pay.

## Some more details
Additional functionalities may be coming soon. If you have any ideas, please reach out. This app is currently being prototyped in 
Java, and will then move to swift and be finished before the end of 2020.
